# CrowdStrike-removal-and-monitoring
This repository contains a PowerShell script designed to monitor and remove CrowdStrike driver files that may be targeted or tampered with by attackers. The script provides real-time file integrity monitoring, alerts administrators if changes are detected, and can shut down the system to prevent further damage.
